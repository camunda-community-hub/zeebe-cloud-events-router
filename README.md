# Zeebe Knative / Cloud Events Worker

This project focus in providing a bridge between Zeebe + BPMN to Knative and Cloud Events to provide Cloud Events orchestration using Zeebe Workflows. 


# Service Task Properties

Properties
- HOST
- TYPE
- MODE: 
  - EMIT_ONLY: 
  - WAIT_FOR_CLOUD_EVENT: 
- WAIT_TYPE: Cloud Event Type to wait 

The worker has two modes:
- EMIT ONLY: It will emit a Cloud Event and complete the Job
- WAIT FOR CLOUD EVENT: It will wait to receive Cloud Event with a specific Type which will be correlated by the workflow and job key to complete the Service Task. 
 

# Endpoints

The worker expose HTTP Endpoints to recieve Cloud Events that can be propagated to workflows. 

- / POST - > Receive Cloud Event via HTTP that will map to a Job
- /message POST -> Receive a Cloud Event that will be forwarded as a BPMN Message for an Intermediate Catch Event 


You can always access the Open API UI here: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
